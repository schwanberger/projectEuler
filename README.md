Quick info about Project Euler (from https://projecteuler.net/)

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

Problems that I deem interesting and their solutions will be posted here.
